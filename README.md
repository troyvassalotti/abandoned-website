# abandoned-website
Websites can be bought and live on forever...or so long as the domain name continues to be renewed. As a result, some sites just become abandoned, living in the aether, but because of backwards compatibility they don't really _look_ abandoned.

Well, what if they did? What if the website detiorated over time, things fell apart, and the darkness came to consume it?
